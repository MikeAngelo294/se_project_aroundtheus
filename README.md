# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is the beginning of implementing responsive designs and using media queries. Media queries ensure the webpage runs smoothly across all devices with different screen resolutions. The original Figma webpage was given beforehand; therefore, the layouts for desktop and mobile are seen to be implemented into HTML and CSS code blocks. BEM methodology is also appropriately used to ensure the coding process is as efficient and coherent as possible.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
